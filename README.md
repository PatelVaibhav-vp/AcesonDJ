# AcesonDJ
A music discord bot that works with YouTube link. I created it with Discord JS 13. You can use it anywhere.

All dependencies that I used in this Project.
    "@discordjs/opus": "^0.9.0",
    "@discordjs/voice": "^0.14.0",
    "@types/node": "^18.0.6",
    "discord.js": "^13.10.3",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "ffmpeg": "^0.0.4",
    "ffmpeg-static": "^5.1.0",
    "fs": "^0.0.1-security",
    "libsodium-wrappers": "^0.7.10",
    "node-fetch": "^3.2.6",
    "npm": "^9.2.0",
    "yt-search": "^2.10.3",
    "ytdl-core": "^4.11.2"
    
I'm giving this info so you don't install other version and get error in code.

Just use npm i in terminal after installing code.
